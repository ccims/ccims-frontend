Subsequent viewers can then immediately access the cached data.\n\nTo check if data is loaded, use #hasData,\nand to check if data is still loading, use #loading.\nTo (re-)load the data from the API, use #load.\nThis happens automatically upon subscription after a sufficient delay (see debounce time constants).\nTo add a subscriber without triggering this behavior, use #subscribeLazy, which will\nonly make an API request if the data is not cached.\nTo invalidate (i.e. delete) the cached data, use #invalidate.\nIf you only need the data right now and don't want to deal with subscriptions, use #dataAsPromise\nto access it as a promise that will either return cached data or load new data.\n\nWhen done using a DataQuery subscription, it must be manually destroyed by calling\nsub.unsubscribe() on the Subscription object returned by\nsubscribe, as it may leak memory otherwise.\nSee DataNode and DataList for the two main types of data that use DataQuery.\n\n

combination with an `Observable`.\n * The component expects that either an `ng-template` or a `MatButton` is in the body and that the appropriate directive\n * is used on it ({@link QueryBodyDirective} with `ng-template`, {@link QueryButtonDirective} with `button`).\n * Once the appropriate function is called, the component subscribes to the observable, showing the user a loading\n * indication and, if applicable, disables the `button`.\n * Once the query finished, the content in the `ng-template` is shown or the button is enabled again.\n * If the subscription yielded an error, a message is shown instead of the `ng-template`, or the button is re-enabled.\n * Note that no verification has to be made if the query was successful, when using an `ng-template`.\n * The content of the `ng-template` is only executed once the {@link #queryState} is `Ready`.\n *\n * #### Example 1: Using `ng-template`\n * This example will show, instead of the content directly, a loading indicator as soon as the page is loaded.\n * ```html\n * \n *   \n *     This will only be shown if the query was successful!\n *      Not required! -->\n *     Result is: {{this.data}}\n *

query will be undefined!\n *\n *   this.query.listenTo(this.someObservable,\n *     result => {\n *       this.data = result;\n *       console.log('Result callback');\n *     },\n *     error => {\n *       console.log('Error callback');\n *     }\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * #### Example 2: Using `button`\n * This example will subscribe to the observable as soon as the button is clicked.\n * The button is disabled and a loading indicator is shown as long as the subscription has not yielded a result.\n * ```html\n * \n *   \n *     Do something that takes a while...\n *   \n * \n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n * // ...\n *\n * @ViewChild(QueryComponent) query: QueryComponent;\n *\n * // ...\n *\n * onClick() {\n *   this.query.listenTo(this.somethingThatTakesAWhile,\n *     result => {\n *       console.log('Result callback');\n *     },\n *     error => {\n *       console.log('Error callback');\n *     }\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n */\n@Component({\n  templateUrl: 'query.component.html',\n

* The component expects that either an `ng-template` or a `MatButton` is in the body and that the appropriate directive\n * is used on it ({@link QueryBodyDirective} with `ng-template`, {@link QueryButtonDirective} with `button`).\n * Once the appropriate function is called, the component subscribes to the observable, showing the user a loading\n * indication and, if applicable, disables the `button`.\n * Once the query finished, the content in the `ng-template` is shown or the button is enabled again.\n * If the subscription yielded an error, a message is shown instead of the `ng-template`, or the button is re-enabled.\n * Note that no verification has to be made if the query was successful, when using an `ng-template`.\n * The content of the `ng-template` is only executed once the {@link #queryState} is `Ready`.\n *\n * #### Example 1: Using `ng-template`\n * This example will show, instead of the content directly, a loading indicator as soon as the page is loaded.\n * ```html\n * \n *   \n *     This will only be shown if the query was successful!\n *      Not required! -->\n *     Result is: {{this.data}}\n *      -->\n *   \n * \n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n * // ...\n *\n * @ViewChild(QueryComponent) query: QueryComponent;\n *\n * // ...\n *\n * ngAfterViewInit() {\n *   // Have to use ngAfterViewInit, otherwise query will be undefined!\n *\n *   this.query.listenTo(this.someObservable,\n *     result => {\n *       this.data = result;\n *       console.log('Result callback');\n *     },\n *     error => {\n *       console.log('Error callback');\n *     }\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * #### Example 2: Using `button`\n * This example will subscribe to the observable as soon as the button is clicked.\n * The button is disabled and a loading indicator is shown as long as the subscription has not yielded a result.\n * ```html\n * \n *   \n *     Do something that takes a while...\n *   \n * \n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n * // ...\n *\n * @ViewChild(QueryComponent) query: QueryComponent;\n *\n * // ...\n *\n * onClick() {\n *   this.query.listenTo(this.somethingThatTakesAWhile,\n *     result => {\n *       console.log('Result callback');\n *     },\n *     error => {\n *       console.log('Error callback');\n *     }\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n */\n@Component({\n  templateUrl: 'query.component.html',\n  selector:

The whole idea behind this type of architecture is to decompose functionality into autonomous services. This results into components that are (almost) entirely self-contained and reusable, thus making the whole software developing process much easier.\nEven though component-based architectures have many benefits like ease of deployment, reusability and independence, there are also challenges that need to be resolved. One of the most critical occurs when different components are managed in different issue management systems (IMS). This can lead to issues (in one group of components) not having a direct link to the root issues (in another group of components) that caused them in the first place. Dependencies between components can thus cause bugs to propagate through the components along the call chain.\nGropius is a cross component issue management system (CCIMS) that solves the described problem by enabling direct dependency links over issues which are managed in different issue management systems.\nThe frontend\n\nAs already mentioned, the idea behind Gropius is to manage cross-component issues for component-based architectures. The system graphically models cross-component problems along with the system architecture. The graphical representation is similar to that of an UML component diagram.\nThe system consists of two different parts: 1. the frontend and 2. the backend.\nThe frontend is responsible for visualizing the part of the system the user can interact with aka. the graphical representation of components and issues and also different methods of managing them. Said methods include 1. creating components, interfaces and issues, 2. editing them, 3. analysing the current status of given issues and their propagation, etc. More about this can be found in the next point of this file.\nFurther details: documentation, features, used technologies and structure\nThe github page of the whole project can be found here: https://github.com/ccims.\nThe documentation of the frontend can be found here: http://ccims.github.io/ccims-frontend.\nFurther information regarding how to use the project can be found on page Using the Project located in folder Additional documentation (in the documentation).\nThis includes 1. main features and 2. ditional features.\nFurther information regarding how to manage the project can be found on page Managing the Project located in folder Additional documentation (in the documentation). \nThis includes 1. used technologies, 2. structure of the project, 3. connection with the backend, etc.\nIn case folder Additional documentation is not visible below Getting started (in the documentation), the following code can be run:\ncompodoc -p tsconfig.doc.json --includes additional and then npm run compodoc.\nFolder Additional documentation contains files Using the Project, Managing the Project and Contributors.\nCredits\nFurther information regarding the members who have worked on the frontend of the system can be found on page Contributors located in the documentation.\nLicense\nThis part still needs to be specified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n
