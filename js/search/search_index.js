Subsequent viewers can then immediately access the cached data.\n\nTo check if data is loaded, use #hasData,\nand to check if data is still loading, use #loading.\nTo (re-)load the data from the API, use #load.\nThis happens automatically upon subscription after a sufficient delay (see debounce time constants).\nTo add a subscriber without triggering this behavior, use #subscribeLazy, which will\nonly make an API request if the data is not cached.\nTo invalidate (i.e. delete) the cached data, use #invalidate.\nIf you only need the data right now and don't want to deal with subscriptions, use #dataAsPromise\nto access it as a promise that will either return cached data or load new data.\n\nWhen done using a DataQuery subscription, it must be manually destroyed by calling\nsub.unsubscribe() on the Subscription object returned by\nsubscribe, as it may leak memory otherwise.\nSee DataNode and DataList for the two main types of data that use DataQuery.\n\n

combination with an `Observable`.\n * The component expects that either an `ng-template` or a `MatButton` is in the body and that the appropriate directive\n * is used on it ({@link QueryBodyDirective} with `ng-template`, {@link QueryButtonDirective} with `button`).\n * Once the appropriate function is called, the component subscribes to the observable, showing the user a loading\n * indication and, if applicable, disables the `button`.\n * Once the query finished, the content in the `ng-template` is shown or the button is enabled again.\n * If the subscription yielded an error, a message is shown instead of the `ng-template`, or the button is re-enabled.\n * Note that no verification has to be made if the query was successful, when using an `ng-template`.\n * The content of the `ng-template` is only executed once the {@link #queryState} is `Ready`.\n *\n * #### Example 1: Using `ng-template`\n * This example will show, instead of the content directly, a loading indicator as soon as the page is loaded.\n * ```html\n * \n *   \n *     This will only be shown if the query was successful!\n *      Not required! -->\n *     Result is: {{this.data}}\n *

query will be undefined!\n *\n *   this.query.listenTo(this.someObservable,\n *     result => {\n *       this.data = result;\n *       console.log('Result callback');\n *     },\n *     error => {\n *       console.log('Error callback');\n *     }\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * #### Example 2: Using `button`\n * This example will subscribe to the observable as soon as the button is clicked.\n * The button is disabled and a loading indicator is shown as long as the subscription has not yielded a result.\n * ```html\n * \n *   \n *     Do something that takes a while...\n *   \n * \n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n * // ...\n *\n * @ViewChild(QueryComponent) query: QueryComponent;\n *\n * // ...\n *\n * onClick() {\n *   this.query.listenTo(this.somethingThatTakesAWhile,\n *     result => {\n *       console.log('Result callback');\n *     },\n *     error => {\n *       console.log('Error callback');\n *     }\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n */\n@Component({\n  templateUrl: 'query.component.html',\n

* The component expects that either an `ng-template` or a `MatButton` is in the body and that the appropriate directive\n * is used on it ({@link QueryBodyDirective} with `ng-template`, {@link QueryButtonDirective} with `button`).\n * Once the appropriate function is called, the component subscribes to the observable, showing the user a loading\n * indication and, if applicable, disables the `button`.\n * Once the query finished, the content in the `ng-template` is shown or the button is enabled again.\n * If the subscription yielded an error, a message is shown instead of the `ng-template`, or the button is re-enabled.\n * Note that no verification has to be made if the query was successful, when using an `ng-template`.\n * The content of the `ng-template` is only executed once the {@link #queryState} is `Ready`.\n *\n * #### Example 1: Using `ng-template`\n * This example will show, instead of the content directly, a loading indicator as soon as the page is loaded.\n * ```html\n * \n *   \n *     This will only be shown if the query was successful!\n *      Not required! -->\n *     Result is: {{this.data}}\n *      -->\n *   \n * \n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n * // ...\n *\n * @ViewChild(QueryComponent) query: QueryComponent;\n *\n * // ...\n *\n * ngAfterViewInit() {\n *   // Have to use ngAfterViewInit, otherwise query will be undefined!\n *\n *   this.query.listenTo(this.someObservable,\n *     result => {\n *       this.data = result;\n *       console.log('Result callback');\n *     },\n *     error => {\n *       console.log('Error callback');\n *     }\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * #### Example 2: Using `button`\n * This example will subscribe to the observable as soon as the button is clicked.\n * The button is disabled and a loading indicator is shown as long as the subscription has not yielded a result.\n * ```html\n * \n *   \n *     Do something that takes a while...\n *   \n * \n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n * // ...\n *\n * @ViewChild(QueryComponent) query: QueryComponent;\n *\n * // ...\n *\n * onClick() {\n *   this.query.listenTo(this.somethingThatTakesAWhile,\n *     result => {\n *       console.log('Result callback');\n *     },\n *     error => {\n *       console.log('Error callback');\n *     }\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n */\n@Component({\n  templateUrl: 'query.component.html',\n  selector:

The whole idea behind this type of architecture is to decompose functionality into autonomous services. This results into components that are (almost) entirely self-contained and reusable, thus making the whole software developing process much easier.\nEven though component-based architectures have many benefits like ease of deployment, reusability and independence, there are also challenges that need to be resolved. One of the most critical occurs when different components are managed in different issue management systems (IMS). This can lead to issues (in one group of components) not having a direct link to the root issues (in another group of components) that caused them in the first place. Dependencies between components can thus cause bugs to propagate through the components along the call chain.\nGropius is a cross component issue management system (CCIMS) that solves the described problem by enabling direct dependency links over issues which are managed in different issue management systems.\nThe frontend\n\nAs already mentioned, the idea behind Gropius is to manage cross-component issues for component-based architectures. The system graphically models cross-component problems along with the system architecture. The graphical representation is similar to that of an UML component diagram.\nThe system consists of two different parts: 1. the frontend and 2. the backend.\nThe frontend is responsible for visualizing the part of the system the user can interact with aka. the graphical representation of components and issues and also different methods of managing them. Said methods include 1. creating components, interfaces and issues, 2. editing them, 3. analysing the current status of given issues and their propagation, etc. More about this can be found in the next point of this file.\nCredits\nFurther information regarding the members who have worked on the frontend of the system can be found on page Contributors located in the documentation.\nLicense\nThis part still needs to be specified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No

\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the Project\nThis page lists all the features of the Gropius system and provides a description of how they can be used. In addition, the use of the features is visualized with pictures.\nCreating, Filtering and Deleting Projects\nThe main page contains a list of projects. To create a new project, click the \"Create Project\" button and enter a name and description (optional) for the project. \nThe search field above the project list allows to search for projects and filter the list. \nOnce a project is selected, the project overview is opened. After clicking on \"Delete project\" a confirmation is expected. \nA direct link to the project's component diagram is provided on the right side of each project item in the project list.\n\n\n\n\nProject Overview\nThe \"Project Overview\" view contains the name and ID of the current project, the description that can be edited as well as the \"Delete Project\" button.\n\n\n\n\nGraph and Components\nThe graph of the project represents all components, issues (bugs, feature requests and unclassified issues), interfaces and relations between entities. \nIn the upper left corner there are filters that allow the user to hide different types of issues (bugs, feature requests and unclassified issues) or issue connections to get a better visualization of the components and interfaces. \nIn the upper right corner there is a button to create new components. The user is required to provide a name, repository URL, provider type (IMS), IMS-URL, and description (optional) for the component to be created.   \n\n\n\n\nA new interface is created by connecting two components. The user is expected to provide a name, a type, and optionally a description of the interface.\n \nClicking on a component displays a popup window with a list of issues and details associated with the current component. There, new issues can be created for this component (\"Create issue\" button), issues can be filtered, the details can be edited and the component can be deleted. \nClicking on an interface displays a pop-up window with the interface details and the issues associated with that interface. The \"Create Issue\" button can be used to create new issues associated with this interface.  \n\n\n\n\nIssues (Component Issues and Inteface Issues)\nAn issue can be a bug, a feature request, and an unclassified issue. Issues can be created for interfaces and for components in the component / interface pop-up. The user is expected to specify the issue title, type (bug, feature request, or unclassified), associated components, issue location, labels, assignees (not yet functional), and linked issues. Each of these fields is optional, except for the issue title. New labels for the issues can also be created.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe issues are also displayed as a list in a separate view. Each issue has a title, author, assignees, labels and a category. The list of issues can be filtered and searched for issues. After selecting an issue, its details are displayed and can be edited, the issue can be commented and closed.\nTODO: describe timeline\n \n \n\n\n\nAuthentication\nTo use the app, the user must register or log in.   \n\n\n\n\nTimeline\nAfter an issue is selected on the Issues page, another view is displayed containing a timeline. The timeline visualizes all the changes that have been made to the issue over time.\n\n\n\n\n\nMocked Members Page\nEvery project offers a mocked \"Members\" page. It shows a list of users in the project and\noffers a dialog to add users. However, this area is purely a mock, changes are not persistent\nand there are no other users who have access to the currently handled project.\n\n\n\n\nMocked Settings Menu\nThe application contains a mocked settings menu. The menu includes profile settings to update the display name, username, email and password. What's more, there is an option to create an access token and a \"Dark Mode\" option. However, the menu is purely a mock and changes are not persistent, nor are the latter two features functioning.\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/managing-gropius.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/managing-gropius.html","title":"additional-page - Managing Gropius","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManaging the Project\nDevelopment server\nThis project was generated with Angular CLI version 9.1.12.\nRun npm start for a dev server.

Run npm run compodocfor a documentation server. Navigate to http://localhost:6060/. The documentation will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. The configuration for the documentation is managed in tsconfig.doc.json.\nCode generation from .graphql files\nThe app uses GraphQL instead of REST to communicate with the backend. The graphql files are in the\ndata folder and subdivided by entities they pertain to e.g. label \nWhen you change .graphql files you have to rerun the code generator. It will update the files in\nsrc/generated to match the changes in the .graphql files.:warning: The backend has to be running with debugNoLogin set to true to make the backend schema\ndefinition accessible to the generator via the urls defined in the codegen configuration file.Run npm run generate to execute the codegenerator when this condition is met.\nCode generator explanation\nWe use a codegenerator (https://graphql-code-generator.com/) to create typescript classes from .graphql files\ncontaining queries and mutations. One class per query/mutation. We then use dependency injection to inject objects of theses classes \ninto e.g. services via dependency injection. These objects make it easy to parameterize the mutations and queries and\ninvoke them in typescript code.\nMocked Members Page\nEvery project offers a mocked 'Members' page. It shows a list of users in the project and\noffers a dialog to add users. However this area is purely a mock, changes are not persisted\nand there are no other users who really have access to your project.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/contributors.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/contributors.html","title":"additional-page - Contributors","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContributors\nFrontend Team\n\nFabian Danner\n\nJimmy Wagner\n\nKliment Klimentov\n\nKristina Pencheva\n\nMoritz Pfeffer\n\nTill Mayer\n\nVincent Brandt\n\n\nOthers\n...\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
