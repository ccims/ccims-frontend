Subsequent viewers can then immediately access the cached data.\n\nTo check if data is loaded, use #hasData,\nand to check if data is still loading, use #loading.\nTo (re-)load the data from the API, use #load.\nThis happens automatically upon subscription after a sufficient delay (see debounce time constants).\nTo add a subscriber without triggering this behavior, use #subscribeLazy, which will\nonly make an API request if the data is not cached.\nTo invalidate (i.e. delete) the cached data, use #invalidate.\nIf you only need the data right now and don't want to deal with subscriptions, use #dataAsPromise\nto access it as a promise that will either return cached data or load new data.\n\nWhen done using a DataQuery subscription, it must be manually destroyed by calling\nsub.unsubscribe() on the Subscription object returned by\nsubscribe, as it may leak memory otherwise.\nSee DataNode and DataList for the two main types of data that use DataQuery.\n\n

combination with an `Observable`.\n * The component expects that either an `ng-template` or a `MatButton` is in the body and that the appropriate directive\n * is used on it ({@link QueryBodyDirective} with `ng-template`, {@link QueryButtonDirective} with `button`).\n * Once the appropriate function is called, the component subscribes to the observable, showing the user a loading\n * indication and, if applicable, disables the `button`.\n * Once the query finished, the content in the `ng-template` is shown or the button is enabled again.\n * If the subscription yielded an error, a message is shown instead of the `ng-template`, or the button is re-enabled.\n * Note that no verification has to be made if the query was successful, when using an `ng-template`.\n * The content of the `ng-template` is only executed once the {@link #queryState} is `Ready`.\n *\n * #### Example 1: Using `ng-template`\n * This example will show, instead of the content directly, a loading indicator as soon as the page is loaded.\n * ```html\n * \n *   \n *     This will only be shown if the query was successful!\n *      Not required! -->\n *     Result is: {{this.data}}\n *

query will be undefined!\n *\n *   this.query.listenTo(this.someObservable,\n *     result => {\n *       this.data = result;\n *       console.log('Result callback');\n *     },\n *     error => {\n *       console.log('Error callback');\n *     }\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * #### Example 2: Using `button`\n * This example will subscribe to the observable as soon as the button is clicked.\n * The button is disabled and a loading indicator is shown as long as the subscription has not yielded a result.\n * ```html\n * \n *   \n *     Do something that takes a while...\n *   \n * \n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n * // ...\n *\n * @ViewChild(QueryComponent) query: QueryComponent;\n *\n * // ...\n *\n * onClick() {\n *   this.query.listenTo(this.somethingThatTakesAWhile,\n *     result => {\n *       console.log('Result callback');\n *     },\n *     error => {\n *       console.log('Error callback');\n *     }\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n */\n@Component({\n  templateUrl: 'query.component.html',\n

* The component expects that either an `ng-template` or a `MatButton` is in the body and that the appropriate directive\n * is used on it ({@link QueryBodyDirective} with `ng-template`, {@link QueryButtonDirective} with `button`).\n * Once the appropriate function is called, the component subscribes to the observable, showing the user a loading\n * indication and, if applicable, disables the `button`.\n * Once the query finished, the content in the `ng-template` is shown or the button is enabled again.\n * If the subscription yielded an error, a message is shown instead of the `ng-template`, or the button is re-enabled.\n * Note that no verification has to be made if the query was successful, when using an `ng-template`.\n * The content of the `ng-template` is only executed once the {@link #queryState} is `Ready`.\n *\n * #### Example 1: Using `ng-template`\n * This example will show, instead of the content directly, a loading indicator as soon as the page is loaded.\n * ```html\n * \n *   \n *     This will only be shown if the query was successful!\n *      Not required! -->\n *     Result is: {{this.data}}\n *      -->\n *   \n * \n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n * // ...\n *\n * @ViewChild(QueryComponent) query: QueryComponent;\n *\n * // ...\n *\n * ngAfterViewInit() {\n *   // Have to use ngAfterViewInit, otherwise query will be undefined!\n *\n *   this.query.listenTo(this.someObservable,\n *     result => {\n *       this.data = result;\n *       console.log('Result callback');\n *     },\n *     error => {\n *       console.log('Error callback');\n *     }\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * #### Example 2: Using `button`\n * This example will subscribe to the observable as soon as the button is clicked.\n * The button is disabled and a loading indicator is shown as long as the subscription has not yielded a result.\n * ```html\n * \n *   \n *     Do something that takes a while...\n *   \n * \n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n * // ...\n *\n *

The whole idea behind this type of architecture is to decompose functionality into autonomous autonomous components, e.g., microservices. This results into components that are (almost) entirely self-contained and reusable, thus making the whole software developing process much easier.\nEven though component-based architectures have many benefits like ease of deployment, there are also challenges that need to be resolved. One of the most critical occurs when different components are managed in different issue management systems (IMS). This can lead to issues (in one group of components) not having a direct link to the root issues (in another group of components) that caused them in the first place. Dependencies between components can thus cause bugs to propagate through the components along the call chain.\nGropius is a cross component issue management system (CCIMS) that solves the described problem by enabling direct dependency links over issues which are managed in different issue management systems.\nThe frontend\nAs already mentioned, the idea behind Gropius is to manage cross-component issues for component-based architectures. The system graphically models cross-component problems along with the system architecture. The graphical representation is similar to that of an UML component diagram.\nArchitecture of the project:\n\n\n\nfrontend\nbackend\nIMS\n\n\n\n\nccims-frontend\nccims-backend\nccims-backend-gql\n\n\n\nThe current repository handles the frontend of the Gropius system. The frontend is responsible for visualizing the part of the system the user can interact with aka. the graphical representation of components and issues and also different methods of managing them. Said methods include 1. creating components, interfaces and issues, 2. editing them, 3. analysing the current status of given issues and their propagation, etc.\nBelow is an example how Gropius visualizes a project as a graph. It shows all the components, issues, interfaces and links between the issues. As seen on the picture, a bug (red symbol) in Component 1 has propagated to Component 2, Component 3 and Component 4 because of Interface A that is connecting them all. What's more, Component 1 and Component 4 have feature requests (blue symbol) that need to be handled. Above the graph there are different check boxes / buttons that make handling the graph much easier, e.g., the fourth one shows / hides connections between linked issues. A search bar can help the user find a component / interface / issue by filtering for a specific text or label. The button in the top right corner is used to create new components. And there are also many other pages the user can visit, like \"Settings\", \"Issues\", etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course the frontend of the Gropius system includes many more features.

\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the Project\nThis page lists all the features of the Gropius system and provides a description of how they can be used. In addition, the use of the features is visualized with pictures.\nCreating, Filtering and Deleting Projects\nThe main page contains a list of projects. To create a new project, click the \"Create Project\" button and enter a name and description (optional) for the project. \nThe search field above the project list allows to search for projects and filter the list. \nOnce a project is selected, the project overview is opened. After clicking on \"Delete project\" a confirmation is expected. \nA direct link to the project's component diagram is provided on the right side of each project item in the project list.\n\n\n\n\nProject Overview\nThe \"Project Overview\" view contains the name and ID of the current project, the description that can be edited as well as the \"Delete Project\" button.\n\n\n\n\nGraph and Components\nThe graph of the project represents all components, issues (bugs, feature requests and unclassified issues), interfaces and relations between entities. \nIn the upper left corner there are filters that allow the user to hide different types of issues (bugs, feature requests and unclassified issues) or issue connections to get a better visualization of the components and interfaces. \nIn the upper right corner there is a button to create new components. The user is required to provide a name, repository URL, provider type (IMS), IMS-URL, and description (optional) for the component to be created.   \n\n\n\n\nA new interface is created by connecting two components. The user is expected to provide a name, a type, and optionally a description of the interface.\n \nClicking on a component displays a popup window with a list of issues and details associated with the current component. There, new issues can be created for this component (\"Create issue\" button), issues can be filtered, the details can be edited and the component can be deleted. \nClicking on an interface displays a pop-up window with the interface details and the issues associated with that interface. The \"Create Issue\" button can be used to create new issues associated with this interface.  \n\n\n\n\nIssues (Component Issues and Inteface Issues)\nAn issue can be a bug, a feature request, and an unclassified issue. Issues can be created for interfaces and for components in the component / interface pop-up. The user is expected to specify the issue title, type (bug, feature request, or unclassified), associated components, issue location, labels, assignees (not yet functional), and linked issues. Each of these fields is optional, except for the issue title. New labels for the issues can also be created.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe issues are also displayed as a list in a separate view. Said view is either displayed as a component / interface pop-up, or it is shown in page \"Issues\". Each issue has a title, author, assignees, labels and a category. The list of issues can be filtered so that specific ones will be targeted. After selecting an issue, its details are displayed on its own issue details page. There the issue can be edited, commented and closed. What's more, the details page for each issue includes a timeline, more about which can be found in section Timeline. \n\n\n\n\n\nTimeline\nAfter an issue is selected in page \"Issues\", the issue details page for the corresponding issue opens. There the issue can be managed. All changes made to the issue are reflected on its own timeline. In a way, the timeline visualizes the whole lifecycle of an issue, including: a) when it has been created, b) who and how has edited it, c) who has commented it, d) what labels have been assigned to it, e) which user has been assigned to it, f) to which other issue / component / interface it has been linked and finally g) who has closed it.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthentication\nTo use the app, the user must first sign up (if no account has been created yet) and then log in to the corresponding account. The sign up form requires a username, email and password. More details about the user's account can be managed in the settings menu once the user has logged in.  \n\n\n\n\nMocked Members Page\nEvery project offers a mocked \"Members\" page. It shows a list of users in the project and\noffers a dialog to add users. However, this area is purely a mock, changes are not persistent\nand there are no other users who have access to the currently handled project.\n\n\n\n\nMocked Settings Menu\nThe application contains a mocked settings menu. The menu includes profile settings to update the display name, username, email and password. What's more, there is an option to create an access token and a \"Dark Mode\" option.

The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nProject structure\nHave a look at the routing module to get a nice overview\nof the primary components of the app.\n\n\n\nAspect\nCode\n\n\n\n\nApp Layout\nFrameComponent\n\n\nGraph\nGraphsModule, look at the declarations\n\n\nProject Context\nStateService\n\n\nAccount Management and Auth with Backend\nLoginComponent, RegisterComponent, AuthenticationService, AuthGuard\n\n\nApollo GraphQL Client Setup\nGraphQLModule\n\n\nType Definitions for Data from Backend  Helper Objects for Queries & Mutations  All of this is output of code generator\ngenerated\n\n\n\nDocumentation generation\nThe documentation is generated with Compodoc. Run npm run compodocfor a documentation server. Navigate to http://localhost:6060/. The documentation will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. The configuration for the documentation is managed in tsconfig.doc.json.\nBindings to the Backend API\nThe app uses GraphQL to communicate with the backend.\nThe following documentation will assume you are familiar with the CCIMS backend API.\nThere are currently two different APIs for communicating with the backend:\ndata API\nThe data API provides simple wrappers around the inner GraphQL queries\n(e.g. ComponentStoreService) that can be included into any Angular class using dependency\ninjection.\nGraphql source files are located in the data directory, subdivided by the entities\nthey pertain to (components, issues, etc.)\nRefer to the code documentation for the handler of each entity type for more information.\nIt is not recommended that you use the data API for new code, as it has several drawbacks:\n\nQueries do not have any granularity: a lot of list queries will fetch all items in that list at\nonce, without any pagination. A lot of node queries will fetch the node and all of its child nodes\nused in the GUI, often every time the GUI control accessing the data is created.\nUpdates to data in one area (e.g. changing the name of a component) are not propagated to other\nareas. This is, however, sort of canceled out by the fact that data is reloaded every time.\n\ndata-dgql API\nThe declarative data API attempts to improve upon the data API by introducing following new\nconcepts:\n\nDataNode: a shared, cached view into a node, agnostic of where the data was loaded from.\nData may be loaded by lists, parent nodes, or queries about the node itself.\nAll subscribers to the node (such as GUI components) can see the data and any updates\nsimultaneously.\nViewers will cause data to be loaded by default, but can be configured to prefer cached data\n(with subscribeLazy - useful when data has already been loaded by a DataList).\nDataList: a view into a list that makes use of pagination and provides an interface for\nserver-side filtering.\nLists will automatically load data into the corresponding DataNode of each item.\nDataQuery: a superclass of both DataNode and DataList that contains common methods.\nDataService: a single injectable that provides access to all data.\nData is accessed using NodeIds and ListIds.\nNodeId: DataNodes are identified by a Node ID, which is a backend ID with a type tag.\nListId: The specific list a DataList will provide a view into is identified by a List ID.\nList IDs are a NodeId with a list type tag\n(e.g. \"the list of issues (type) in component abcdef (node)\").\n\nAlso see the code documentation for more information.\nCode generation from .graphql files\nWe use a code generator (https://graphql-code-generator.com/) to create typescript classes from\n.graphql files containing queries and mutations. The code generator generates one Angular service\nclass per query/mutation. These can then be included using dependency injection. These objects make\nit easy to parameterize the mutations and queries and invoke them in typescript code.\nYou should, however, never need to use the GraphQL queries directly, as abstractions are provided in\ndata and data-dgql.\nWhen you change .graphql files you have to rerun the code generator.\nIt will update the files in src/generated to match the changes in the .graphql files.\n:warning: The backend has to be running with debugNoLogin set to true to make the backend schema\ndefinition accessible to the generator via the urls defined in the codegen configuration file.Run npm run generate to execute the code generator when this condition is met.\nMocked Members Page\nEvery project offers a mocked 'Members' page. It shows a list of users in the project and\noffers a dialog to add users. However this area is purely a mock, changes are not persisted\nand there are no other users who really have access to your project.\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/contributors.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/contributors.html","title":"additional-page - Contributors","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContributors\nFrontend Team\n\nFabian Danner, Fabiandanner\n\nJimmy Wagner, Jimmy-Wagner\n\nKliment Klimentov, KKlimentov1618 \n\nKristina Pencheva, Kristinapn\n\nMoritz Pfeffer, moemode\n\nTill Mayer, tlmrgvf\n\nVincent Brandt, st161848\n\n\nOthers\n...\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
