an API request, DataQuery lets you declare the ID (like an endpoint) and\n * request parameters (in {@link #params}) of the data you want, and will automatically load the data when needed.\n * Data can then be accessed synchronously with the {@link #current} property.\n *\n * Upon adding a subscriber with [#subscribe]{@link Observable#subscribe}, data will loaded from the API and stored in the\n

Subsequent viewers can then immediately access the cached data.\n\nTo check if data is loaded, use #hasData,\nand to check if data is still loading, use #loading.\nTo (re-)load the data from the API, use #load.\nThis happens automatically upon subscription after a sufficient delay (see debounce time constants).\nTo add a subscriber without triggering this behavior, use #subscribeLazy, which will\nonly make an API request if the data is not cached.\nTo invalidate (i.e. delete) the cached data, use #invalidate.\nIf you only need the data right now and don't want to deal with subscriptions, use #dataAsPromise\nto access it as a promise that will either return cached data or load new data.\n\nWhen done using a DataQuery subscription, it must be manually destroyed by calling\nsub.unsubscribe() on the Subscription object returned by\nsubscribe, as it may leak memory otherwise.\nSee DataNode and DataList for the two main types of data that use DataQuery.\n\n

Instead of calling a function to make an API request, DataQuery lets you declare the ID (like an endpoint) and\n * request parameters (in {@link #params}) of the data you want, and will automatically load the data when needed.\n * Data can then be accessed synchronously with the {@link #current} property.\n *\n * Upon adding a subscriber with [#subscribe]{@link Observable#subscribe}, data will loaded from the API and stored in the\n * cache.

for interacting with an API object.\n * Instead of calling a function to make an API request, DataQuery lets you declare the ID (like an endpoint) and\n * request parameters (in {@link #params}) of the data you want, and will automatically load the data when needed.\n * Data can then be accessed synchronously with the {@link #current} property.\n *\n * Upon adding a subscriber with [#subscribe]{@link Observable#subscribe}, data will loaded from the API and stored in the\n * cache. Subsequent viewers can then immediately access the cached data.\n *\n * - To check if data is loaded, use {@link #hasData},\n *   and to check if data is still loading, use {@link #loading}.\n * - To (re-)load the data from the API, use {@link #load}.\n *   This happens automatically upon subscription after a sufficient delay (see debounce time constants).\n * - To add a subscriber without triggering this behavior, use {@link #subscribeLazy}, which will\n *   only make an API request if the data is not cached.\n * - To invalidate (i.e. delete) the cached data, use {@link #invalidate}.\n * - If you only need the data right now and don't want to deal with subscriptions, use {@link #dataAsPromise}\n *   to access it as a promise that will either return cached data or load new data.\n *\n * When done using a DataQuery subscription, it *must* be manually destroyed by calling\n * [`sub.unsubscribe()`]{@link Subscription#unsubscribe} on the Subscription object returned by\n * [subscribe]{@link Observable#subscribe}, as it may leak memory otherwise.\n *\n * See {@link DataNode} and {@link DataList} for the two main types of data that use DataQuery.\n *\n * @typeParam T - type of data accessible via .current\n * @typeParam R - type returned by innerQueryFn\n * @typeParam P - parameter type for innerQueryFn\n */\nexport abstract class DataQuery extends Observable {\n  /** The ID of this data. */\n  id: I;\n  loading = false;

QueryBodyDirective} with `ng-template`, {@link QueryButtonDirective} with `button`).\n * Once the appropriate function is called, the component subscribes to the observable, showing the user a loading\n * indication and, if applicable, disables the `button`.\n * Once the query finished, the content in the `ng-template` is shown or the button is enabled again.\n * If the subscription yielded an error, a message is shown instead of the `ng-template`, or the button is re-enabled.\n * Note that no verification has to be made if the query was successful, when using an `ng-template`.\n * The content of the `ng-template` is only executed once the {@link #queryState} is `Ready`.\n *\n * #### Example 1: Using `ng-template`\n * This example will show, instead of the content directly, a loading indicator as soon as the page is loaded.\n * ```html\n * \n *   \n *     This will only be shown if the query was successful!\n *      Not required! -->\n *     Result is: {{this.data}}\n *

query will be undefined!\n *\n *   this.query.listenTo(this.someObservable,\n *     result => {\n *       this.data = result;\n *       console.log('Result callback');\n *     },\n *     error => {\n *       console.log('Error callback');\n *     }\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * #### Example 2: Using `button`\n * This example will subscribe to the observable as soon as the button is clicked.\n * The button is disabled and a loading indicator is shown as long as the subscription has not yielded a result.\n * ```html\n * \n *   \n *     Do something that takes a while...\n *   \n * \n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n * // ...\n *\n * @ViewChild(QueryComponent) query: QueryComponent;\n *\n * // ...\n *\n * onClick() {\n *   this.query.listenTo(this.somethingThatTakesAWhile,\n *     result => {\n *

* The component expects that either an `ng-template` or a `MatButton` is in the body and that the appropriate directive\n * is used on it ({@link QueryBodyDirective} with `ng-template`, {@link QueryButtonDirective} with `button`).\n * Once the appropriate function is called, the component subscribes to the observable, showing the user a loading\n * indication and, if applicable, disables the `button`.\n * Once the query finished, the content in the `ng-template` is shown or the button is enabled again.\n * If the subscription yielded an error, a message is shown instead of the `ng-template`, or the button is re-enabled.\n * Note that no verification has to be made if the query was successful, when using an `ng-template`.\n * The content of the `ng-template` is only executed once the {@link #queryState} is `Ready`.\n *\n * #### Example 1: Using `ng-template`\n * This example will show, instead of the content directly, a loading indicator as soon as the page is loaded.\n * ```html\n * \n *   \n *     This will only be shown if the query was successful!\n *      Not required! -->\n *     Result is: {{this.data}}\n *      -->\n *   \n * \n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n * // ...\n

callback');\n *     }\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * #### Example 2: Using `button`\n * This example will subscribe to the observable as soon as the button is clicked.\n * The button is disabled and a loading indicator is shown as long as the subscription has not yielded a result.\n * ```html\n * \n *   \n *     Do something that takes a while...\n *   \n * \n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n * // ...\n *\n *

Run npm run compodocfor a documentation server. Navigate to http://localhost:6060/. The documentation will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. The configuration for the documentation is managed in tsconfig.doc.json.\nCodegeneration from .graphql files\nThe app uses GraphQL instead of REST to communicate with the backend. The graphql files are in the\ndata folder and subdivided by entities they pertain to e.g. label \nWhen you change .graphql files you have to rerun the code generator. It will update the files in\nsrc/generated to match the changes in the .graphql files.:warning: The backend has to be running with debugNoLogin set to true to make the backend schema\ndefinition accessible to the generator via the urls defined in the codegen configuration file.Run npm run generate to execute the codegenerator when this condition is met.\nCodegenerator explanation\nWe use a codegenerator (https://graphql-code-generator.com/) to create typescript classes from .graphql files\ncontaining queries and mutations. One class per query/mutation. We then use dependency injection to inject objects of theses classes \ninto e.g. services via dependency injection. These objects make it easy to parameterize the mutations and queries and\ninvoke them in typescript code.\nMocked Members Page\nEvery project offers a mocked 'Members' page. It shows a list of users in the project and\noffers a dialog to add users. However this area is purely a mock, changes are not persisted\nand there are no other users who really have access to your project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n
